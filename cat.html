<h1>Some infomation about Cats</h1>
<p>
The cat (Felis catus) is a small carnivorous mammal.<br>
It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and often referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish it from wild members of the family.<br>
 The cat is either a house cat, kept as a pet, or a feral cat, freely ranging and avoiding human contact.<br>
 A house cat is valued by humans for companionship and for its ability to hunt rodents. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries.<br>
